<SEO title="100daysofcode | Day9" />

Started Scott Tolinski's 'Better Javascript' today to re-start my Java mastery.

I knew I was getting better at JS when, while doing a fCC algorithm, my \*first stab as a solution made use of the spread operator.

Yay, me, I know, but I'm glad ES6 is making sense now since ES7, ES8 and ES9 seem to be right around the corner. Or I might say ...ESwhatever
