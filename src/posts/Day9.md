<SEO title="100daysofcode | Day9" />

Started Scott Tolinski's 'Better Javascript' today to re-start my Java mastery.

I knew I was getting better at JS when, while doing a fCC algorithm, my \*first stab as a solution made use of the spread operator.

Yay, me, I know, but I'm glad ES6 is making sense now since `let ESall = [ES7, ES8, ES9]` seem to be right around the corner. Or I should say `...ESall`

Oh, and nested destructuring kinda scares me.
