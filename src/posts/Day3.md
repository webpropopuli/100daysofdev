      Things like #100daysofcode, or the latest 30-day Challenge have a deeper purpose - they change our habits.
      There is all kinds of sciency stuff about how even small, repeated efforts can have a huge impact on our lives. Since I don't do sciency here, go look at <a href="https://www.tinyhabits.com/"></a>B.J Fogg's work</a> and see/try for yourself
