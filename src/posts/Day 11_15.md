<SEO title="100daysofcode | Day11-15" />

A handful of similar days plowing through freeCodeCamp.

I might have taken a day off for New Year's but I can't remember. This headache....

I'm 4 projects from my first certification now. I'd be further along but after the summer rework, but they built in a pretty cool self-checker module in CodePen, so I had to update the [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/webpropopuli/pen/BvPgVW)

Lots of green boxes....yay. 4... more... ugh... but these are easy - more tedious than difficult. Will power through them later this week.
