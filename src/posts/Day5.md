Took a Gatsby break today to figure out how to finish freeCodeCamp.

fCC rebuilt their site over the summer and I had been progressing through it under the old system. After the re-design, what was once a nice, orderly progression turned into a sad smattering of accomplishments spread over a totally different curriculum.
It was ugly.
I took some time today to map out what I have left in, at least, the first four certificate paths. Still ugly but now I can see my way to the end without having to drill down into the (pretty awful) fCC interface.
I mean seriously, did fCC never imagine that people might want an easy way of viewing their progress?
Anyway, I'll post that image tomorrow as I haven't figured out the right way to add images to posts in Gatsby. Yeah, yeah - I know the diry way, but not the cool, Gagsby-way. (I'm hoping there is one - probably a plugin I haven't seen yet.)
