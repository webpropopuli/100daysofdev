The blog is now dynamically creating pages from markdown, which is super cool. All kinds of good stuff going in tomorrow.

I added another green completion box to my fCC matrix. Feels like a drop in the ocean at the moment, but there is a path if I take these one at a time and stop looking at all four certifications at one time.
