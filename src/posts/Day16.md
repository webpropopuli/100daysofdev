## CSS is my black beast.

Man, I wish I'd learned this properly instead of one thing at a time spread over 2 years. I have no framework in my head, I've always just figured out what I need when I needed it.

Taking the fCC course helped somewhat, and I finally made sense of some things I'd seen but didn't quite know, but I'm still getting it into my head.

Today, I went deep into hiding and showing bits of content based oninput from other elements. Lots of toggle() and getElementById() call flying about and _I found a major letdown in CSS_ there's no way to re-position the mouse pointer based on an event.

Seriously? It can't even be done in JS!?!
(I'm probably just a crying noob and totally wrong, but I spent hours on this and even my friends at StackExchange let me down.)

The internet is broken....
