Client day.

Taking care of some client website work today and fighting tooth-and-nail with CSS.

Learned a lot of what doesn't work this afternoon, but also realized that my CSS fundamentals are basically crap.

I learned what CSS I know by figuring out "the next line of code" but there's a ton of stuff I just do because "it worked the last time". Thus I've identified a CSS refresher for this week and I'll talk about that in a day or two.

As a sign from above, this week's [Syntax FM](https://syntax.fm/) podcast is titled [CSS Layout](https://syntax.fm/show/104/css-layout) and you should know by know how much I love those guys.
