    #Day2 is better than 1
    <p>Today's thought</p>
    <blockquote>Excuses are the walls in the House of Failure</blockquote>
    <p>
      That cheerful quote came to me this morning as I thought about how much
      more I could have done yesterday if I wasn't wasting time.

      I wanted to be much further along in Gatsby by now, as I'm know that I
      can't do daily blogs by manually creating pages like this.

      Though it's pretty slick how easy Gatsby makes it to create content
      hierarchy - just create the tree you want in your /src directory and add a
      file.

      But it's somewhat ugly as I have to write code <strong>and</strong>{' '}
      content together. I'll roll this into the finished blog when it's ready.
      Let's see how the day goes....
