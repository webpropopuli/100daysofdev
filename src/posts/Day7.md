<SEO title="100daysofcode | Day7" />

I'm alive!

You're possibly already seeing me at [my hosting area](https://100days.webpropopuli.com), but today is the day that finally happened.

I had lost track of the simplicity of static sites and went looking at Netlify and GitPages as solutions, but a simple FTP to my own subdomain is about as easy as it gets. Yes, I don't have the automatic updates from GitHub but, if I wanted to, I could run a local script to automate the upload. Probably not worth the effort to save fifteen seconds.
