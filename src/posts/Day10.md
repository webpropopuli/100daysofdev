<SEO title="100daysofcode | Day10" />

I put 3 new green squares on my freeCodeCamp Certifications List, meaning I'm three sections closer to getting them certs.

I took the SASS course, sure that I'll never use it, but it was kinda cool since I can now - at the very least - _read_ some of the stylesheets I've been blindly using over the years.

Goodbye [#rebeccapurple](https://medium.com/@valgaze/the-hidden-purple-memorial-in-your-web-browser-7d84813bb416) - your story touched me more that I can say, but I have to go my own way now.
